I'm a third-year undergraduate student from [School of CS](http://cs.hitsz.edu.cn/), [Harbin Institute of Technology， ShenZhen](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/index.html). My research interest includes natural language processing and machine learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xuebo Liu](https://sunbowliu.github.io/) of HITSZ-ICI-哈翻深圳团队 Lab from [School of Computer Science](http://cs.hitsz.edu.cn/), Harbin Institute of Technology， ShenZhen.

My CV is here: [Xinyu Ma's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
