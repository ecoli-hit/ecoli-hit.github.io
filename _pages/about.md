I'm a third-year undergraduate student from [School of CS](http://cs.hitsz.edu.cn/), [Harbin Institute of Technology， ShenZhen](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/index.html). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xuebo Liu](https://sunbowliu.github.io/) of HITSZ-ICI-HappyTrans team from [School of Computer Science](http://cs.hitsz.edu.cn/), Harbin Institute of Technology，ShenZhen.
My CV is here: [Xinyu Ma's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV.pdf).
## Research Interest
My research interest includes natural language processing and machine translation ：
+  low-resource machine translation
+  multilingual translation
+  parameter-efficiency tuning

## News 
+ 【2023.6.24】EMNLP2023 Conference submission, my very first paper "Clustering Pseudo Language Family in Multilingual Translation Models with Fisher Information Matrix".
+ We propose an approach that leverages Fisher Information to search the task specific parameters of pretrained multilingual model to represent language pairs and propose Pseudo Family for language clustering.

## Research
+ 【On process】EMNLP2023 Conference submission "Clustering Pseudo Language Family in Multilingual Translation Models with Fisher Information Matrix"
  +  We introduce a novel approach to pseudo language family clustering, which is inherently dependent on the MNMT model itself. Our proposed methodology hypothesizes that language pairs exhibiting similarities in their impact on model parameters are likely to possess a high level of congruence and should, consequently, be grouped together. We employ the fisher information matrix (FIM) to quantify such similarities between language pairs. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by enhancing low-resource NMT with pseudo language family clustering, yielding superior results when compared to the conventional use of language family categorization.

## Competition
+ The 4th IKCEST The Belt and Road International Big Data Competition and the 8th Baidu & Xian Jiaotong University Big Data Competition
  + We complete eight directions from Chinese $$ \leftrightarrow $$ French, French to Chinese, Chinese to Russian, Russian to Chinese, Chinese to Thai, Thai to Chinese, Chinese to Arabic and Arabic to Chinese.
+ ASC22 Student Supercomputer Challenge


## Experience
+ teaching assistant
  + COMP2008 Principles of computer composition experience

## Miscellaneous
+ [Prof. Xuebo Liu](https://sunbowliu.github.io/) is an exceptionally outstanding mentor who has provided me with invaluable assistance in my research endeavors. He has guided me in developing systematic research habits and has been a guiding light throughout my research journey.
+ I like playing football and badminton.
