I'm a third-year undergraduate student from [School of CS](http://cs.hitsz.edu.cn/), [Harbin Institute of Technology， ShenZhen](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/index.html). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xuebo Liu](https://sunbowliu.github.io/) of HITSZ-ICI-HappyTrans team from [School of Computer Science](http://cs.hitsz.edu.cn/), Harbin Institute of Technology，ShenZhen.
My CV is here: [Xinyu Ma's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV.pdf).
## Research Interest
My research interest includes natural language processing and machine translation ：
+  low-resource machine translation
+  multilingual translation
+  parameter-efficiency tuning

## News 
+ 【2023.6.24】EMNLP2023 Conference submission, my very first paper "Clustering Pseudo Language Family in Multilingual Translation Models with Fisher Information Matrix".
+ We propose an approach that leverages Fisher Information to search the task specific parameters of pretrained multilingual model to represent language pairs and propose Pseudo Family for language clustering.

## Research
+ 【On process】EMNLP2023 Conference submission "Clustering Pseudo Language Family in Multilingual Translation Models with Fisher Information Matrix"
